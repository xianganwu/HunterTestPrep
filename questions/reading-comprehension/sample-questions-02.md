## Passage A

Read the following passage and answer questions 1-5.

```
     The Brooklyn Bridge, completed in 1883, was considered an
     engineering marvel of its time. Spanning the East River, it
     connected the then-separate cities of New York and Brooklyn,
     fundamentally changing how people lived and worked in the region.
5    Its construction took fourteen years and cost the lives of at least
     twenty workers, including its original designer, John Augustus
     Roebling, who died from tetanus after his foot was crushed during
     initial surveying.

     His son, Washington Roebling, took over the project but soon
10   suffered from decompression sickness—known then as "the bends"—
     from spending too much time in the underwater caissons used to
     build the bridge's foundations. Confined to his apartment, he
     directed the remaining construction by watching through a telescope
     while his wife, Emily Warren Roebling, served as the crucial link
15   between him and the engineers on site. Emily studied mathematics,
     engineering, and materials science to effectively communicate
     her husband's instructions and eventually took on many duties of
     chief engineer herself.

     When the bridge finally opened, Emily Roebling was the first
20   person to cross it, carrying a rooster as a symbol of victory.
     Today, the bridge stands not only as a monument to engineering
     achievement but as a testament to the determination and sacrifice
     of an entire family.

## Passage B

Read the following passage and answer questions 6-10.

```
     When I was ten, my grandmother taught me to make her famous
     dumplings in her tiny kitchen above the bakery on Mott Street.
     The fluorescent light hummed overhead as she guided my clumsy
     fingers through the delicate process of folding the dough just so,
5    creating the distinctive pleats that marked her style.

     "Patience," she would say, her voice gentle but firm. "The
     filling will wait. The dough will not." I didn't understand then
     that she was teaching me more than cooking. Each fold was a lesson
     in attention, in respecting the materials before me, in understanding
10   that some things cannot be rushed.

     Years later, when she was gone and I stood in my own kitchen,
     I found that my hands remembered what my mind had forgotten. The
     flour felt familiar, the dough yielded to my touch in ways that
     surprised me. Her voice returned: patient, encouraging, present in
15   a way that defied her absence.

     Now I teach my daughter, her small fingers struggling as mine
     once did, and I hear myself saying "patience" in a voice that sounds
     less like mine and more like an echo traveling across generations.
     The dumplings we make are never perfect, but perfection was never
20   the point. The point was the standing together, the flour on our
     hands, the quiet understanding that some things must be passed down
     person to person, hand to hand, or they will be lost forever.
```

## Passage C

Read the following passage and answer questions 11-15.

```
     Scientists have long debated whether animals possess true
     consciousness—an awareness of themselves as distinct individuals
     with thoughts and feelings. While skeptics argue that animal
     behavior can be explained through instinct and conditioning alone,
5    recent research suggests otherwise.

     In one landmark study, researchers placed mirrors in the enclosures
     of various great apes. After initial confusion, many of the apes
     began using the mirrors to examine parts of their bodies they couldn't
     normally see, such as the inside of their mouths or their backs.
10   When researchers placed a mark on the apes' foreheads that could
     only be seen in a mirror, several subjects touched their own
     foreheads upon seeing their reflection—suggesting they understood
     that the image in the mirror was themselves, not another animal.

     This "mirror test" has since been passed by elephants, dolphins,
15   and even certain species of fish, challenging the assumption that
     self-awareness is uniquely human. However, critics point out that
     the test may be biased toward species that rely heavily on vision.
     A dog, for instance, might not recognize itself in a mirror but
     could potentially identify its own scent, demonstrating a different
20   form of self-awareness that current tests fail to measure.

     As our understanding grows, the line between human and animal
     cognition continues to blur, raising important ethical questions
     about how we treat other species.
```

### Question 11

The primary purpose of this passage is to

(A) argue that animals should have the same rights as humans
(B) explain how mirrors are manufactured
(C) discuss evidence for animal self-awareness and its implications
(D) criticize scientists who study animal behavior
(E) describe how to train apes to use mirrors

### Question 12

According to the passage, what did the marked apes' behavior suggest?

(A) They were afraid of the mirrors
(B) They thought the reflection was another animal
(C) They recognized themselves in the mirror
(D) They wanted to remove the mirrors from their enclosures
(E) They had been trained to respond to marks

### Question 13

The author mentions dogs (lines 18-20) in order to

(A) prove that dogs are smarter than apes
(B) suggest a limitation of the mirror test
(C) argue that dogs should be included in more studies
(D) demonstrate that all animals have self-awareness
(E) show that dogs cannot recognize themselves

### Question 14

The word "blur" in line 22 most nearly means

(A) become less visible
(B) become less distinct
(C) become more colorful
(D) move very quickly
