## Passage A

Read the following passage and answer questions 1-5.

```
     In the heart of New York City, where skyscrapers pierce the clouds
     and yellow taxis weave through crowded streets, there exists a
     quieter world that most pedestrians overlook. Central Park's
     Ramble, a 36-acre woodland, serves as an unexpected sanctuary
5    for over 230 species of birds. During spring and fall migrations,
     birdwatchers from across the country gather at dawn, binoculars
     in hand, hoping to catch a glimpse of warblers, thrushes, and
     tanagers that stop to rest in this urban oasis.

     The park's location along the Atlantic Flyway—a major bird
10   migration route stretching from the Arctic to South America—makes
     it a critical stopover point. After crossing miles of developed
     land and water, exhausted birds descend into Central Park's
     greenery, attracted by the trees, shrubs, and water sources that
     provide food and shelter. For many species, this small patch of
15   wilderness in the middle of Manhattan can mean the difference
     between completing their journey and perishing from exhaustion.

     Dr. Sarah Chen, an ornithologist at the American Museum of Natural
     History, has studied Central Park's bird populations for two
     decades. "What makes this place remarkable," she explains, "is
20   not just the diversity of species, but how the birds have adapted
     to an urban environment. They've learned to navigate around
     buildings, to time their movements with traffic patterns, and to
     find food sources that wouldn't exist in traditional habitats."

## Passage B

Read the following poem and answer questions 6-9.

```
     The city sleeps beneath a quilt of snow,
     Each streetlamp wearing halos in the night.
     The subway rumbles somewhere far below,
5    While footprints fill with crystals, silver-white.

     I walk alone through empty avenues,
     Past shuttered shops and windows dark with dreams.
     The cold transforms the ordinary views
     Into a world more quiet than it seems.

10   Tomorrow's rush will melt this moment's peace,
     The shovels scrape, the buses start to run.
     But now, this hush grants me a brief release—
     A private winter before morning's sun.

## Passage C

Read the following passage and answer questions 10-14.

```
     Twelve-year-old Marcus pressed his face against the museum
     glass, his breath creating a small fog circle that he quickly
     wiped away with his sleeve. Behind the barrier stood the most
     magnificent chess set he had ever seen—pieces carved from ivory
5    and ebony, each figure a tiny masterpiece of medieval warriors
     and nobility.

     "Excuse me," said a voice behind him. Marcus turned to find
     an elderly woman with silver hair and kind eyes. "You've been
     standing here for twenty minutes. Are you a chess player?"

10   Marcus nodded, suddenly shy. "My grandfather taught me. He
     says chess teaches you to think three moves ahead in life, not
     just on the board."

     The woman smiled. "Your grandfather sounds wise. I'm Dr.
     Okonkwo, the museum curator. Would you like to know the history
15   of this set?"

     For the next hour, Marcus learned that the chess pieces had
     survived wars, crossed oceans, and passed through the hands of
     kings and scholars. Each piece, Dr. Okonkwo explained, carried
     not just beauty but centuries of human story.

20   "History isn't just about dates and battles," she told him as
     they parted. "It's about the objects that connect us to people
     we'll never meet but somehow understand."

     Walking home that evening, Marcus saw the city differently—
     every old building, every weathered statue seemed to whisper
25   its own story, waiting for someone to listen.
```
