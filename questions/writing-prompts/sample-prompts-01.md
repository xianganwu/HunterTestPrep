## Sample Prompt 1: Family

Being part of a family means something different to everyone. "Family" is something that we each describe and define differently; it is a collection of various people in our lives. For some, "family" refers to those people who are a part of their household; for others, "family" stretches to include members of their community.

**Write an essay or tell a true story that captures what "family" means to you.**

Your writing should:
- Define and describe what "family" means to you
- Use sensory detail to create a vivid image of the meaning of "family"
- Convey the significance of "family" in your life

## Sample Prompt 2: A Place in New York

New York City is a place of countless neighborhoods, parks, buildings, and hidden corners. Some places become special to us—a quiet bench in a park, a busy corner, a library reading room, or a spot where we watch the city go by.

**Describe a place in New York City that is meaningful to you and explain why.**

Your writing should:
- Use descriptive language to bring the place to life
- Explain your personal connection to this place
- Show, rather than just tell, why this place matters to you

## Sample Prompt 4: An Object That Tells a Story

**Write about an object that is meaningful to you and the story behind it.**

Your writing should:
- Describe the object with sensory details

Read the beginning of this story, then continue it in your own words:

**Continue this story. What happens next?**

Your writing should:
- Continue naturally from the given beginning

## Sample Prompt 8: Creative Writing - A Different Perspective

Your writing should:
