# Reading Comprehension Sample Questions - Set 1: Answer Key

## Passage A (Central Park Birds)

### Question 1
**Answer: (B) a refreshing refuge surrounded by development**

**Explanation:** An "oasis" traditionally refers to a fertile area in a desert, suggesting a place of relief or refuge in an otherwise harsh environment. In this context, Central Park serves as a natural haven (refreshing refuge) surrounded by the urban development of New York City. The comparison emphasizes the park's role as a sanctuary amidst the concrete and buildings.

### Question 2
**Answer: (B) It is located along a major migration route**

**Explanation:** Lines 9-11 state that "The park's location along the Atlantic Flyway—a major bird migration route stretching from the Arctic to South America—makes it a critical stopover point." This directly supports answer (B). The passage does not claim it is the only green space (A), that it was designed for conservation (C), that it has the most tree species (D), or that it is federally protected (E).

---

### Question 3
**Answer: (B) informative and appreciative**

**Explanation:** The passage provides factual information about bird migration and Central Park (informative) while using positive language like "remarkable," "sanctuary," and "unexpected" to convey appreciation for the park's role. The tone is neither critical (A), humorous (C), skeptical (D), nor coldly detached (E).

### Question 4
**Answer: (C) have successfully adjusted to city life**

**Explanation:** Lines 20-23 quote Dr. Chen explaining that the birds have "adapted to an urban environment" and "learned to navigate around buildings, to time their movements with traffic patterns, and to find food sources that wouldn't exist in traditional habitats." This describes successful adaptation to city life. The passage doesn't discuss their appearance (A), songs (B), travel distances (D), or endangered status (E).

---

### Question 5
**Answer: (B) face significant survival challenges**

**Explanation:** Lines 14-16 state that "For many species, this small patch of wilderness in the middle of Manhattan can mean the difference between completing their journey and perishing from exhaustion." This implies that without the park, migrating birds would face serious challenges to their survival.

## Passage B (Snow Poem)

### Question 6
**Answer: (C) personification**

**Explanation:** Personification is giving human qualities to non-human things. "Wearing halos" describes the streetlamps as if they were people wearing something, giving them a human characteristic. A simile (A) would use "like" or "as." Hyperbole (B) is exaggeration. Alliteration (D) is repeated consonant sounds. Onomatopoeia (E) is words that sound like what they describe.

---

### Question 7
**Answer: (B) peaceful and reflective**

**Explanation:** The poem describes a quiet, solitary walk through a snow-covered city with phrases like "this hush grants me a brief release" and "A private winter." The mood is calm and contemplative, not anxious (A), angry (C), confused (D), or particularly joyful (E).

---

### Question 8
**Answer: (C) people inside are sleeping**

**Explanation:** The phrase "dark with dreams" suggests that the windows are dark because the people inside are asleep and dreaming. This interpretation fits with the nighttime setting and the poem's quiet atmosphere. The other interpretations are too literal or unrelated to the context.

---

### Question 9
**Answer: (C) the fleeting nature of the peaceful moment**

**Explanation:** The final stanza contrasts the current peaceful moment ("this hush," "a brief release") with the coming morning when "shovels scrape" and "buses start to run." This contrast emphasizes that the peaceful moment is temporary and will soon end—it is fleeting. The poem is not about seasonal differences (A), disliking buses (B), dangers (D), or weather forecasts (E).

## Passage C (Museum Chess Set)

### Question 10
**Answer: (B) works of artistic excellence**

**Explanation:** The word "masterpiece" refers to a work of outstanding artistry or skill. By calling the chess pieces "tiny masterpieces," Marcus is expressing his view that they are works of artistic excellence, regardless of their small size. The phrase doesn't suggest they're impractical (A) or that their value is only in their age (C).

---

### Question 11
**Answer: (C) develops skills applicable to real life**

**Explanation:** Lines 10-12 quote Marcus saying his grandfather believes "chess teaches you to think three moves ahead in life, not just on the board." This indicates the grandfather believes chess develops thinking skills that apply to real-life situations, not just the game itself.

---

### Question 12
**Answer: (C) the human connections found in history**

**Explanation:** In lines 20-22, Dr. Okonkwo states that history "is about the objects that connect us to people we'll never meet but somehow understand." This emphasizes her value for the human connections that historical objects can create across time.

---

### Question 13
**Answer: (C) has gained a new perspective on his surroundings**

**Explanation:** Lines 23-25 describe how "Marcus saw the city differently—every old building, every weathered statue seemed to whisper its own story." This shows he has gained a new way of seeing and appreciating his environment after his experience at the museum.

---

### Question 14
**Answer: (B) a young person's transformative encounter**

**Explanation:** The passage follows Marcus's experience at the museum, where meeting Dr. Okonkwo and learning about the chess set changes how he sees the world. This is the primary focus—a transformative encounter that shifts his perspective. While the passage mentions chess (A), the curator (C), and his grandfather (D), these are not the main focus.
