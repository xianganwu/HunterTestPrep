---

### Question 7
**Answer: (B) physical memory can persist beyond conscious recollection**

---

### Question 8
**Answer: (C) reflective and tender**

**Explanation:** The passage looks back on memories with warmth and affection. Words like "gentle," "patient," "encouraging," and the overall nostalgic quality indicate a reflective, tender tone. The narrator cherishes these memories and shares them lovingly.

---

### Question 9
**Answer: (C) the value of the experience was in the connection, not the result**

## Passage C (Animal Consciousness)

### Question 11
**Answer: (C) discuss evidence for animal self-awareness and its implications**

**Explanation:** The passage presents the scientific debate about animal consciousness, describes the mirror test evidence, discusses its limitations, and notes the ethical implications. Its primary purpose is to discuss evidence and implications, not to argue for animal rights (A) or criticize scientists (D).

---

### Question 12
**Answer: (C) They recognized themselves in the mirror**

**Explanation:** Lines 10-13 describe apes touching their own foreheads upon seeing the mark in the mirror, "suggesting they understood that the image in the mirror was themselves, not another animal." This demonstrates self-recognition.

---

### Question 13
**Answer: (B) suggest a limitation of the mirror test**

**Explanation:** The author notes that dogs might not pass the mirror test but could identify their own scent, "demonstrating a different form of self-awareness that current tests fail to measure." The dog example illustrates that the mirror test may be biased toward visual species and miss other forms of self-awareness.

---

### Question 14
**Answer: (B) become less distinct**

**Explanation:** "The line between human and animal cognition continues to blur" means that the distinction or boundary between human and animal thinking is becoming harder to define clearly—less distinct. The discoveries are making the difference less clear-cut.

---

### Question 15
**Answer: (C) Self-awareness may exist in more species than previously thought**

**Explanation:** The passage emphasizes that the mirror test has been "passed by elephants, dolphins, and even certain species of fish, challenging the assumption that self-awareness is uniquely human." This supports the idea that self-awareness is more widespread than previously believed.
