## Prompt

Being part of a family means something different to everyone. "Family" is something that we each describe and define differently; it is a collection of various people in our lives. For some, "family" refers to those people who are a part of their household; for others, "family" stretches to include members of their community.

**Write an essay or tell a true story that captures what "family" means to you.**

### The Sunday Morning Kitchen

Every Sunday morning, my grandmother's kitchen transforms into a symphony of sizzling pans, clattering dishes, and overlapping conversations in three languages. The smell of garlic and ginger wafts through the apartment as my aunts argue over who makes the best dumplings, while my little cousins run between their legs, stealing scraps of dough to shape into tiny, misshapen creations.

This is what family means to me—not just the people who share my last name, but the chaos and comfort that comes when we all squeeze around a table too small for our numbers.

My grandfather sits in his worn armchair by the window, pretending to read the newspaper but actually listening to every word we say. He rarely speaks, but when he does, the whole room falls silent. "Family," he told me once, "is not about blood. It is about who shows up." I didn't understand him then, but I think I do now.

When my mother was sick last winter, our neighbors, the Garcias, brought food every day for two weeks. Mrs. Garcia sat with my mother while I was at school, reading to her in Spanish—a language my mother doesn't even understand. But somehow, the sound of someone caring was enough. At my grandmother's table the following Sunday, Mrs. Garcia had a seat, squished between my aunt and the window, learning to fold dumplings with flour-covered fingers.

Family, I've come to realize, is elastic. It stretches to include the people who choose us and whom we choose back. It's my best friend Marcus, who knows exactly when I need silence and when I need someone to make me laugh. It's my basketball coach, who drove forty minutes to watch my school play even though I only had two lines.

But family is also something you build actively, with patience and presence. It means showing up for the boring moments—the Sunday mornings of routine, the phone calls that say nothing important, the sitting together in comfortable silence. These small moments, stacked on top of each other, become the foundation of something unbreakable.

When I sit at my grandmother's crowded table, reaching across my cousins to grab the last dumpling, I know I am part of something larger than myself. The kitchen is too hot, the conversation too loud, and there's never enough room. But that's exactly what family feels like—a little too much, in the best possible way.

## Tips for Writing Your Own Response

1. **Start with a scene**: Drop the reader into a specific moment rather than beginning with a general statement.

2. **Use concrete details**: Names, places, and specific sensory details make your writing come alive.

3. **Include reflection**: Don't just describe—explain what events mean to you and why they matter.

4. **Be honest**: Authentic experiences, even small ones, are more compelling than dramatic invented stories.

5. **End meaningfully**: Your conclusion should leave the reader with something to think about, not just summarize what you've already said.
