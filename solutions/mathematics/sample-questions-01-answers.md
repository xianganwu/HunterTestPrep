## Detailed Explanations

### Question 1
**Answer: (C) 24**

If 3/4 of a number is 18:
- Let the number be x
- (3/4)x = 18
- x = 18 × (4/3)
- x = 72/3 = 24

---

### Question 2
**Answer: (B) 40 cm**

Perimeter of rectangle = 2(length + width)
- P = 2(12 + 8)
- P = 2(20)
- P = 40 cm

---

### Question 3
**Answer: (C) 5.0**

2.5 + 3.75 - 1.25
- = 6.25 - 1.25
- = 5.0

---

### Question 4
**Answer: (D) 150 miles**

2 hours 30 minutes = 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 60 × 2.5 = 150 miles

---

### Question 5
**Answer: (B) 12**

15% of 80:
- = 0.15 × 80
- = 12

Alternative: 10% of 80 = 8, 5% of 80 = 4, so 15% = 8 + 4 = 12

---

### Question 6
**Answer: (C) 25**

Average = Sum ÷ Number of items
- 24 = (20 + 22 + 25 + 28 + x) ÷ 5
- 120 = 95 + x
- x = 25

---

### Question 7
**Answer: (D) 2/5**

Total marbles = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15
- P(blue) = 6/15 = 2/5

Note: Answer choice (E) 6/15 is the same as (D) 2/5, but 2/5 is the simplified form.

---

### Question 8
**Answer: (C) 10**

(-3) × (-4) + (-2)
- = 12 + (-2)
- = 12 - 2
- = 10

---

### Question 9
**Answer: (B) 8 inches**

Area of square = side²
- 64 = side²
- side = √64 = 8 inches

---

### Question 10
**Answer: (C) 66**

3x² - 2x + 1, where x = 5
- = 3(5)² - 2(5) + 1
- = 3(25) - 10 + 1
- = 75 - 10 + 1
- = 66

---

### Question 11
**Answer: (C) $4.00**

Cost of 8 apples = 8 × $0.75 = $6.00
- Change = $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

---

### Question 12
**Answer: (B) 0.375**

3/8 as a decimal:
- 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375

---

### Question 13
**Answer: (B) 12**

Ratio of boys to girls = 3:4
- Total parts = 3 + 4 = 7
- Each part = 28 ÷ 7 = 4 students
- Boys = 3 × 4 = 12

---

### Question 14
**Answer: (B) 44 cm**

Circumference = π × diameter
- C = (22/7) × 14
- C = 22 × 2 = 44 cm

---

### Question 15
**Answer: (C) 6**

2n + 7 = 19
- 2n = 19 - 7
- 2n = 12
- n = 6

---

### Question 16
**Answer: (D) 120 cubic cm**

Volume = length × width × height
- V = 4 × 5 × 6
- V = 120 cubic cm

---

### Question 17
**Answer: (C) 24**

LCM of 6 and 8:
- Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30...
- Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32...
- LCM = 24

---

### Question 18
**Answer: (D) $36**

20% off means paying 80% of original price:
- Sale price = 0.80 × $45 = $36

Alternative: 20% of $45 = $9, so $45 - $9 = $36

---

### Question 19
**Answer: (D) 10**

Absolute value makes numbers positive:
- |−7| + |3| = 7 + 3 = 10

---

### Question 20
**Answer: (C) 16 square units**

Area of larger square = 5² = 25 square units
Area of shaded square = 3² = 9 square units
- Unshaded area = 25 - 9 = 16 square units

---

### Question 21
**Answer: (D) 15**

If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it must be divisible by their LCM.
- LCM of 3 and 5 = 15

Note: It doesn't have to be divisible by 30 because 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5 but not by 30.

---

### Question 22
**Answer: (C) 1/2**

5/6 − 1/3
- = 5/6 − 2/6 (converting 1/3 to sixths)
- = 3/6
- = 1/2

---

### Question 23
**Answer: (B) 7.5°**

At 3:15:
- Minute hand points at 3 (the 15-minute mark)
- Hour hand has moved 1/4 of the way from 3 to 4
- Each hour = 30° (360° ÷ 12)
- Hour hand movement = 30° × 1/4 = 7.5° past the 3
- Angle between hands = 7.5°

---

### Question 24
**Answer: (C) 162**

Pattern: Each number is multiplied by 3
- 2 × 3 = 6
- 6 × 3 = 18
- 18 × 3 = 54
- 54 × 3 = 162

---

### Question 25
**Answer: (C) 8 gallons**

Set up a proportion:
- 5 gallons / 150 miles = x gallons / 240 miles
- 5/150 = x/240
- x = (5 × 240) ÷ 150
- x = 1200 ÷ 150 = 8 gallons
