## Detailed Explanations

### Quantitative Comparisons

#### Question 1
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

- Column A: 3/5 = 0.60
- Column B: 0.59
- 0.60 > 0.59, so Column A is greater

---

#### Question 2
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

- Column A: 25% of 80 = 0.25 × 80 = 20
- Column B: 80% of 25 = 0.80 × 25 = 20
- Both equal 20

This demonstrates that a% of b = b% of a for any values.

---

#### Question 3
**Answer: (D) Cannot be determined**

For x = 1: x² = 1 and x³ = 1 (equal)
For x = 2: x² = 4 and x³ = 8 (B greater)

Since the relationship depends on the value of x, it cannot be determined.

---

#### Question 4
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

- Column A: Minutes in 2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes
- Column B: Seconds in 2 minutes = 2 × 60 = 120 seconds
- Both equal 120 (though different units)

---

#### Question 5
**Answer: (B) Column B is greater**

When a and b are both negative:
- Column A (a + b): Sum of two negatives is negative
- Column B (a × b): Product of two negatives is positive

A positive number is always greater than a negative number.

---

#### Question 6
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

Perimeter of square = 24 cm
- Side = 24 ÷ 4 = 6 cm
- Area = 6² = 36 sq cm
- Column A = 36 sq cm = Column B

---

#### Question 7
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

- Column A: (-5)² = (-5) × (-5) = 25
- Column B: -(5²) = -(25) = -25
- 25 > -25

---

#### Question 8
**Answer: (B) Column B is greater**

y = 3x + 2, where x = 4
- y = 3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14
- Column A: 14
- Column B: 15
- 15 > 14

---

#### Question 9
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

- Column A: Average of 10, 20, 30 = (10 + 20 + 30) ÷ 3 = 60 ÷ 3 = 20
- Column B: Average of 15, 25 = (15 + 25) ÷ 2 = 40 ÷ 2 = 20
- Both equal 20

---

#### Question 10
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

- Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°
- Column A: One angle of equilateral triangle = 60°
- Column B: 1/3 of 180° = 60°
- Both equal 60°

---

#### Question 11
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

For any integer n > 1:
- Column A: n + 1/n
- Column B: n

Since n > 1, we have 1/n > 0, so n + 1/n > n.

---

#### Question 12
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

- Column A: √49 + √16 = 7 + 4 = 11
- Column B: √(49 + 16) = √65 ≈ 8.06
- 11 > 8.06

Note: √a + √b ≠ √(a + b) in general.

---

### Pattern Recognition

#### Question 13
**Answer: (C) 36**

Pattern: Perfect squares (1², 2², 3², 4², 5², ...)
- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36
- Next term: 6² = 36

---

#### Question 14
**Answer: (D) 96**

Pattern: Each term is doubled (×2)
- 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96
- 48 × 2 = 96

---

#### Question 15
**Answer: (C) 47**

Pattern: Each term is (previous × 2) + 1
- 2 × 2 + 1 = 5
- 5 × 2 + 1 = 11
- 11 × 2 + 1 = 23
- 23 × 2 + 1 = 47
- 47 × 2 + 1 = 95 ✓

---

#### Question 16
**Answer: (B) K**

Pattern: Every other letter (skip one)
- A, C, E, G, I, K
- Skip B, D, F, H, J

---

#### Question 17
**Answer: (B) 5/6**

Pattern: numerator = position, denominator = position + 1
- 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6

---

#### Question 18
**Answer: (D) 12**

Pattern: Third column = sum of first two columns
- Row 1: 3 + 5 = 8 ✓
- Row 2: 4 + 6 = 10 ✓
- Row 3: 5 + 7 = 12

---

### Word Problems

#### Question 19
**Answer: (C) All Bloops are Lazzies**

Logic chain:
- All Bloops → Razzies
- All Razzies → Lazzies
- Therefore: All Bloops → Lazzies

---

#### Question 20
**Answer: (B) Maya**

From the clues:
- Maya finished before Tyler but after Sam → Sam...Maya...Tyler
- Tyler finished before Kira → ...Tyler...Kira
- Dana finished last

Order: Sam (1st), Maya (2nd), Tyler (3rd), Kira (4th), Dana (5th)

---

#### Question 21
**Answer: (C) 11**

Work backwards:
- Final answer: 17
- Before subtracting 5: 17 + 5 = 22
- Before doubling: 22 ÷ 2 = 11

Check: 11 × 2 = 22, 22 - 5 = 17 ✓

---

#### Question 22
**Answer: (B) 5**

Use the inclusion-exclusion principle:
- Students playing at least one sport = Soccer + Basketball - Both
- = 18 + 12 - 5 = 25
- Students playing neither = 30 - 25 = 5

---

#### Question 23
**Answer: (C) 18**

Let the three consecutive even integers be n, n+2, n+4
- n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 48
- 3n + 6 = 48
- 3n = 42
- n = 14

The integers are 14, 16, 18. The largest is 18.

---

#### Question 24
**Answer: (C) 25**

Ratio of red:blue = 2:3
- If red = 10, then 2 parts = 10, so 1 part = 5
- Blue = 3 parts = 15
- Total = 10 + 15 = 25

---

#### Question 25
**Answer: (D) $20.00**

Let original price = P
- After first 10% reduction: P × 0.90
- After second 10% reduction: (P × 0.90) × 0.90 = P × 0.81
- P × 0.81 = $16.20
- P = $16.20 ÷ 0.81 = $20.00
