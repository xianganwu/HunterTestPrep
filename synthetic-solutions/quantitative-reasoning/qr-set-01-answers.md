## Detailed Solutions

### Question 1
**Answer: (B) Column B is greater**

2/3 = 8/12 and 3/4 = 9/12
Since 9/12 > 8/12, Column B (3/4) is greater.

---

### Question 2
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

0.25 × 80 = 20
25% of 80 = 0.25 × 80 = 20
Both equal 20.

---

### Question 3
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

If x is negative:
- x² is positive (negative × negative = positive)
- x³ is negative (negative × negative × negative = negative)
A positive number is always greater than a negative number.

---

### Question 4
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

Square: perimeter = 20, so side = 5, area = 25
Rectangle: area = 6 × 4 = 24
25 > 24

---

### Question 5
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

a + b = 5 + (-3) = 2
a × b = 5 × (-3) = -15
2 > -15

---

### Question 6
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

3⁴ = 81
4³ = 64
81 > 64

---

### Question 7
**Answer: (D) Cannot be determined**

If y = 0: y² = 0, 2y = 0 (equal)
If y = 1: y² = 1, 2y = 2 (B greater)
If y = 3: y² = 9, 2y = 6 (A greater)
The relationship depends on the value of y.

---

### Question 8
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

Prime numbers between 1 and 10: 2, 3, 5, 7 (4 numbers)
Even numbers between 1 and 10: 2, 4, 6, 8 (4 numbers)
Both equal 4.

---

### Question 9
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

5, 12, 13 is a Pythagorean triple (right triangle with legs 5 and 12)
Area = (1/2) × 5 × 12 = 30

---

### Question 10
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6 ≈ 0.833
2/5 = 0.4
5/6 > 2/5

---

### Question 11
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

n² - n = n(n - 1) by factoring
They are algebraically identical.

---

### Question 12
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

√144 + √36 = 12 + 6 = 18
√(144 + 36) = √180 ≈ 13.4
18 > 13.4

Note: √a + √b ≠ √(a + b)

---

### Question 13
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

P(exactly one head) = 2/4 = 1/2 (HT or TH)
P(two heads) = 1/4 (HH only)
1/2 > 1/4

---

### Question 14
**Answer: (B) Column B is greater**

For any positive x, dividing by a smaller number gives a larger result.
x/4 > x/5

---

### Question 15
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

Average = (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50)/5 = 150/5 = 30
Median = middle value = 30
Both equal 30.

---

### Question 16
**Answer: (D) Cannot be determined**

Possible factor pairs of 12:
- m = 1, n = 12: sum = 13
- m = 2, n = 6: sum = 8
- m = 3, n = 4: sum = 7
- m = 4, n = 3: sum = 7
The sum could be equal to, greater than, or less than 7.

---

### Question 17
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

(-2)⁴ = 16 (even power of negative = positive)
-(2⁴) = -16
16 > -16

---

### Question 18
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

Circle with C = 20π: 2πr = 20π, so r = 10
Circle with A = 25π: πr² = 25π, so r² = 25, r = 5, diameter = 10
Both equal 10.

---

### Question 19
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

|−8| + |−3| = 8 + 3 = 11
|−8 + (−3)| = |−11| = 11

Wait, let me recalculate:
Column A: 8 + 3 = 11
Column B: |-8 + (-3)| = |-11| = 11

**Correction: (C) The quantities are equal**

---

### Question 20
**Answer: (D) Cannot be determined**

If x = 5 and y = 5: xy = 25 (equal)
If x = 1 and y = 9: xy = 9 (B greater)
If x = 4 and y = 6: xy = 24 (B greater)
The product is maximized when x = y = 5, giving xy = 25.
For any other positive values, xy < 25.

Actually, by AM-GM inequality, xy ≤ 25 with equality when x = y = 5.
So xy could equal 25 or be less than 25, but never greater.

**Correction: (B) Column B is greater or equal**

Since the question allows for equality at x = y = 5, and all other cases give B greater, the answer is **(D) Cannot be determined** because the relationship varies.

(10b + a) - (10a + b) = 27
9b - 9a = 27
b - a = 3

From a + b = 11 and b - a = 3:
2b = 14, b = 7, a = 4
Original number = 47

Check: 47, digits sum to 11, reversed = 74, difference = 27 ✓
