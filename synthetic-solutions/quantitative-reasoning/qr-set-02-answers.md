## Detailed Solutions

### Question 1
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

5/9 ≈ 0.556
0.556 > 0.55

---

### Question 2
**Answer: (B) Column B is greater**

Column A: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25
Column B: (3 + 4)² = 7² = 49
49 > 25

---

### Question 3
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 (8 factors)
Factors of 25: 1, 5, 25 (3 factors)
8 > 3

---

### Question 4
**Answer: (B) Column B is greater**

For 0 < a < 1, squaring makes the number smaller.
Example: 0.5² = 0.25, and 0.25 < 0.5
So a > a²

---

### Question 5
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

15% of 60 = 0.15 × 60 = 9
60% of 15 = 0.60 × 15 = 9
Both equal 9.

---

### Question 6
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

Circle A: C = 10π, so 2πr = 10π, r = 5
Circle B: A = 16π, so πr² = 16π, r² = 16, r = 4
5 > 4

---

### Question 7
**Answer: (D) Cannot be determined**

If n is even: (-1)ⁿ = 1, (-1)^(n+1) = -1 (A greater)
If n is odd: (-1)ⁿ = -1, (-1)^(n+1) = 1 (B greater)
Depends on whether n is even or odd.

---

### Question 8
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 4/8 + 2/8 + 1/8 = 7/8

---

### Question 9
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

The sum of angles in any triangle is 180°.

---

### Question 10
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

First 10 positive even integers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
Sum = 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 20 = 2(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10) = 2 × 55 = 110

---

### Question 11
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

All primes greater than 2 are odd.
Odd + Odd = Even
So p + q is always even.

---

### Question 12
**Answer: (A) Column A is greater**

2^10 = 1024
10^3 = 1000
1024 > 1000

---

### Question 13
**Answer: (D) Cannot be determined**

If perimeter = 20, then l + w = 10.
- If l = 5, w = 5: Area = 25
- If l = 6, w = 4: Area = 24
- If l = 7, w = 3: Area = 21
Area can be less than, equal to, or... actually maximum area is 25 (when square).
Area ≤ 25, so relationship varies.

---

### Question 14
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

|3 - 7| = |-4| = 4
|7 - 3| = |4| = 4
Both equal 4.

---

### Question 15
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

Average = Sum ÷ Count
40 = Sum ÷ 5
Sum = 200

---

### Question 16
**Answer: (B) Column B is greater**

For x < 0:
- x³ is negative (negative × negative × negative = negative)
- x² is positive (negative × negative = positive)
Positive > Negative

---

### Question 17
**Answer: (C) The quantities are equal**

Diagonals in a polygon = n(n-3)/2
Hexagon (n=6): 6(6-3)/2 = 6(3)/2 = 9

---

### Question 18
**Answer: (B) Column B is greater**

P(red) = 2/5
P(blue) = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5 = 0.6
1/2 = 0.5
3/5 > 1/2

---

## Part B: Pattern Recognition

### Question 19

These are prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...

---

### Question 20
**Answer: (C) 216**

Pattern: Perfect cubes
1³ = 1, 2³ = 8, 3³ = 27, 4³ = 64, 5³ = 125, 6³ = 216

---

### Question 21
**Answer: (D) 63**

Pattern: Each term = (previous × 2) + 1
1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63
31 × 2 + 1 = 63

---

### Question 22
**Answer: (D) 210**

Sum = n(n+1)/2 = 20(21)/2 = 420/2 = 210

---

### Question 23
**Answer: (C) 16**

T₁ = 1
T₂ = 2(1) + 4 = 6
T₃ = 2(6) + 4 = 16

---

### Question 24
**Answer: (D) 120**

Factorials: 1!, 2!, 3!, 4!, 5!, 6!
1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720

---

### Question 25
**Answer: (C) 25**

Pattern: a² + b² = result
2² + 3² = 4 + 9 = 13 ✓
4² + 5² = 16 + 25 = 41 ✓
3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25

---

### Question 26
**Answer: (B) 199**

Arithmetic sequence: first term = 3, common difference = 4
aₙ = 3 + (n-1)(4) = 3 + 4n - 4 = 4n - 1
a₅₀ = 4(50) - 1 = 199

---

### Question 27
**Answer: (D) 89**

Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
9th term = 34, 10th term = 55
Sum = 34 + 55 = 89

---

## Part C: Logical Reasoning

### Question 28
**Answer: (C) No one plays both piano and drums**

This is directly stated: "No one who plays piano plays drums."

---

### Question 29
**Answer: (B) 8**

Using inclusion-exclusion:
Total = French + Spanish - Both
30 = 20 + 18 - Both
Both = 38 - 30 = 8

---

### Question 30
**Answer: (A) 1st from left**

- English is at position 5 (right end)
- Art is not next to English, so not position 4
- Math is between History and Science

If History-Math-Science occupy positions 2-3-4 (or similar arrangement), Art must be at position 1.

---

### Question 31
**Answer: (C) 15**

120 = 4 × 5 × 6
Sum = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

---

### Question 32
**Answer: (A) 7**

Check each:
- 7 ÷ 5 = 1 R 2 ✓, 7 ÷ 3 = 2 R 1 ✓
- 12 ÷ 5 = 2 R 2 ✓, 12 ÷ 3 = 4 R 0 ✗
- 17 ÷ 5 = 3 R 2 ✓, 17 ÷ 3 = 5 R 2 ✗
- 22 ÷ 5 = 4 R 2 ✓, 22 ÷ 3 = 7 R 1 ✓

Wait, 22 also works. Let me recheck:
- 7: 7 = 5(1) + 2, 7 = 3(2) + 1 ✓
- 22: 22 = 5(4) + 2, 22 = 3(7) + 1 ✓

Both 7 and 22 satisfy the conditions, but only 7 is among the choices where both conditions are met first. Answer is (A) 7.

---

### Question 33
**Answer: (C) 13**

T₁ = 2, T₃ = 5
Since T₃ = T₁ + T₂: 5 = 2 + T₂, so T₂ = 3
T₄ = T₂ + T₃ = 3 + 5 = 8
T₅ = T₃ + T₄ = 5 + 8 = 13

---

### Question 34
**Answer: (C) 8**

Number of handshakes = n(n-1)/2
28 = n(n-1)/2
56 = n(n-1)
56 = 8 × 7
n = 8 people

---

### Question 35
**Answer: (D) 45°**

At 4:30:
- Minute hand: at 6 (180°)
- Hour hand: halfway between 4 and 5

Hour hand at 4:00 is at 120° (4 × 30°)
In 30 minutes, hour hand moves 15° (30 × 0.5°)
Hour hand at 4:30 is at 135°

Angle between hands = 180° - 135° = 45°
