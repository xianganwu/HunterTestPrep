## Passage A: The Language of Whales

### Question 1
**Answer: (C) dismissed as superstition or ship noises**

---

### Question 2
**Answer: (B) technology originally intended for military purposes**

### Question 3
**Answer: (B) organized and purposeful**

### Question 4

---

### Question 6
**Answer: (C) represent a form of learned cultural behavior**

**Explanation:** Lines 24-26 explicitly state the songs "represent a form of culture—knowledge passed not through genes but through learning, one generation to the next."

## Passage B: The Rooftop Garden

### Question 10
**Answer: (C) approached the project with determination and planning**

**Explanation:** The lines describe Maya finding grants, watching videos, writing a proposal, hauling soil, recruiting neighbors, and learning from failure—all signs of determination and systematic planning.

---

### Question 11
**Answer: (C) gained knowledge by making and correcting mistakes**

**Explanation:** "Learned through failure" means Maya made mistakes and learned from them to improve—the classic trial-and-error learning process. This contradicts natural talent (A), giving up (B), blaming others (D), or avoiding difficulty (E).

---

### Question 12
**Answer: (B) created a space that brought people together**

---

## Passage C: The Mathematics of Honeybees

### Question 13
**Answer: (B) describe how honeybees communicate location through dance**

**Explanation:** The entire passage focuses on explaining the waggle dance and how it communicates direction and distance to food sources. It's not primarily arguing intelligence (A), explaining life cycles (C), comparing to human language (D), or criticizing scientists (E).

---

### Question 14
**Answer: (C) the direction relative to the sun**

**Explanation:** Lines 9-13 explain that "The angle of the waggle run relative to vertical indicates the direction of the food relative to the sun." The angle specifically communicates direction, while duration communicates distance (B).

---

### Question 15
**Answer: (C) 3 miles away**

**Explanation:** Lines 14-17 state "each second of waggling represents about half a mile." Six seconds × 0.5 miles/second = 3 miles.

---

### Question 16
**Answer: (C) interpreted**

**Explanation:** Von Frisch "decoded" the dance by figuring out what the movements meant—he interpreted the meaning of the bee's communication. He didn't destroy (A), invent (B), memorize (D), or simplify (E) it.

---

### Question 17
**Answer: (B) movements symbolically represent real-world information**

**Explanation:** Lines 23-26 explain the abstract nature: bees use "a symbolic language where movements represent real-world information—direction and distance translated into angles and time." The movements are symbols, not literal pointing.

---

### Question 18
**Answer: (C) relate bee communication to familiar human methods**

**Explanation:** The comparison helps readers understand the bee's solution by relating it to something humans use for the same purpose—communicating location. It's not suggesting inspiration (A), simplicity (B), bee technology use (D), or criticizing humans (E).
