---

### Question 2
**Answer: (C) wanted to prevent books from being destroyed**

**Explanation:** Lines 8-10 state that Crane was "Unable to bear the thought of books being destroyed" and "spent forty years rescuing volumes destined for incinerators and garbage trucks."

### Question 4
**Answer: (C) admiring and respectful**

**Explanation:** The passage portrays Crane positively, describing his "stubborn devotion" and noting that a library wing "bears Crane's name."

---

### Question 5
**Answer: (D) emphasize the broader significance of Crane's efforts**

**Explanation:** The final paragraph states the exhibit "serves as a reminder that preservation often depends not on institutions with vast resources, but on individuals with stubborn devotion."

---

### Question 8
**Answer: (D) echolocation signals**

**Explanation:** The passage lists magnetic field detection (line 10), sun and star positions (lines 11-12), polarized light patterns (line 12), and smell (line 13). Echolocation is never mentioned. This is a "EXCEPT" question, so (D) is correct because it's NOT mentioned.

### Question 9
**Answer: (C) enables them to use wind patterns to save energy**

**Explanation:** Lines 15-17 explain that terns "follow a winding path that takes advantage of prevailing winds" and that this "requires less effort than fighting against headwinds."

---

### Question 10
**Answer: (B) ride air currents to reduce effort**

---

### Question 11
**Answer: (C) contrast human thinking with the terns' evolved wisdom**

**Explanation:** Lines 15-18 explain that Eliza read about "desert beetles" whose "shells had microscopic bumps that attracted water from fog," inspiring her fabric design. The idea came from a library book about insects, not her grandmother (A), school (B), watching rain (D), or Marcus (E).

---

### Question 17
**Answer: (C) learning from mistakes is essential to invention**

## Passage D: Poetry Selection

### Question 19
**Answer: (C) metaphor**
