## Reading Comprehension Strategies

### Approach to Passages

1. **Skim the passage first** to get the main idea
2. **Read the questions** before detailed reading
3. **Return to the passage** to find specific answers
4. Use line numbers provided to locate relevant text

### Question Order Strategy

Tackle questions in this order:
1. **Vocabulary questions** - Usually straightforward
2. **Line-specific questions** - Direct reference to text
3. **General meaning/tone questions** - Require full passage understanding

### Vocabulary in Context

- Don't rely on memorized definitions
- Read the sentence with the word
- Try substituting each answer choice
- Choose the option that maintains the sentence's meaning

### Inference Questions

- Look for clues in the text
- The answer must be supported by evidence
- Avoid extreme or absolute answers unless clearly stated

### Common Traps

- Answers that are true but don't answer the question
- Partially correct answers
- Answers using exact words from the passage (may be out of context)

4. **Execute** - do the calculation
5. **Check** - verify your answer makes sense

### Drawing and Modeling

- **Draw pictures** for geometry problems
- **Create simple diagrams** for word problems
- **Use tables** to organize rate/time/distance problems
- **Make lists** for counting problems

### Fractions, Decimals, and Percents

- Know conversions cold (1/4 = 0.25 = 25%)
- Practice operations without a calculator
- Look for opportunities to simplify before calculating

### Multi-Step Problems

- Break complex problems into smaller steps
- Write out intermediate calculations
- Double-check each step before proceeding

### Common Topics to Master

## Quantitative Reasoning Strategies

### Quantitative Comparisons

For questions asking you to compare two quantities:

- **A** if quantity in Column A is greater
- **B** if quantity in Column B is greater
- **C** if the two quantities are equal
- **D** if the relationship cannot be determined

### Strategies for Comparisons

- Simplify both sides if possible
- Try plugging in numbers (positive, negative, zero, fractions)
- Look for common factors to cancel
- Be wary of variables - the answer might be "cannot be determined"

### Pattern Recognition

- Look for mathematical relationships
- Consider sequences (arithmetic, geometric)
- Check for visual symmetry
- Test your pattern with given examples
