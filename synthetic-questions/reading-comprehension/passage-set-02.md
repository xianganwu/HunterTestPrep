## Passage A: The Language of Whales

```
     For centuries, sailors reported hearing mysterious sounds rising
     from the depths of the ocean—eerie moans, clicks, and what some
     described as songs. Many dismissed these accounts as superstition
     or the creaking of wooden ships. It was not until the 1960s, when
5    the U.S. Navy began using underwater microphones to detect enemy
     submarines, that scientists first recorded the complex vocalizations
     of humpback whales.

     What they discovered astonished them. Humpback whale songs are not
     random noises but structured compositions that can last up to
10   twenty minutes before repeating. Each song contains distinct phrases
     arranged in themes, similar to verses in human music. Even more
     remarkably, all the male humpbacks in a given ocean basin sing the
     same song during a breeding season—and that song gradually evolves
     over months, with new phrases appearing and old ones disappearing.

15   Dr. Katy Payne, a researcher at Cornell University, spent decades
     studying these songs. She found that changes spread through whale
     populations like cultural trends spread through human societies.
     When a new phrase appears in one whale's song, neighboring whales
     begin incorporating it into their own versions, and the change
20   ripples outward across thousands of miles of ocean.

     Scientists still debate the purpose of whale songs. Some believe
     they attract mates; others suggest they help whales navigate or
     establish territory. What is clear, however, is that these songs
     represent a form of culture—knowledge passed not through genes
25   but through learning, one generation to the next. In this way,
     the songs of whales remind us that humans are not the only
     creatures capable of creating and sharing traditions.

## Passage B: The Rooftop Garden

```
     Maya pressed her hands into the soil, feeling the cool dampness
     against her fingers. Six months ago, this rooftop had been nothing
     but cracked concrete and broken glass, a forgotten space above
     the bodega where her grandmother had worked for thirty years.
5    Now tomato plants climbed wooden stakes, beans spiraled up
     improvised trellises made from old bicycle wheels, and marigolds
     bloomed in bright orange clusters along the edges.

     "You have your grandfather's hands," Abuela said, kneeling beside
     her with a watering can. "He could make anything grow, even in
10   the worst soil in Aguascalientes."

     Maya had never met her grandfather, who had died before she was
     born, but she liked to think she understood him through moments
     like this—the satisfaction of coaxing life from unlikely places.
     The rooftop garden had been her idea, proposed during the long
15   months of the pandemic when the apartment walls seemed to close
     in tighter each day. Her mother had been skeptical. The building
     superintendent had been more than skeptical; he had laughed.

     But Maya had done her research. She had found grants for urban
     gardens, watched countless videos on container gardening, and
20   written a proposal that convinced the building owner to let her
     try. She had hauled fifty-pound bags of soil up six flights of
     stairs, recruited neighbors to help build raised beds, and
     learned through failure which plants thrived in rooftop conditions.

     Now, Mr. Patterson from 4B brought his morning coffee up here.
25   The Delgado twins did their homework at the wooden table Maya's
     uncle had built. And Abuela—who had not climbed to the roof in
     twenty years—came up every evening to water her peppers and
     watch the sun set over the city.

     "You did something good, mija," Abuela said. "You grew more than
30   vegetables. You grew a neighborhood."
```

## Passage C: The Mathematics of Honeybees

```
     When a honeybee discovers a promising source of nectar, it faces
     a remarkable challenge: how to communicate the location to its
     hive mates who have never been there. Bees cannot draw maps or
     give verbal directions. Instead, they have evolved an extraordinary
5    solution known as the waggle dance.

     Upon returning to the hive, the forager bee performs a figure-eight
     pattern on the vertical surface of the honeycomb. The central
     portion of this figure-eight—the "waggle run"—contains precise
     information about the food source. The angle of the waggle run
10   relative to vertical indicates the direction of the food relative
     to the sun. If the bee waggles straight up, the food is toward
     the sun; if she waggles 60 degrees to the right of vertical, the
     food is 60 degrees to the right of the sun.

     The duration of the waggle run communicates distance. Roughly
15   speaking, each second of waggling represents about half a mile
     to the food source. A bee returning from a flower patch two miles
     away will waggle for approximately four seconds. Other bees
     observe the dance closely, then fly off in the indicated direction
     and distance, often finding the exact flowers their sister visited.

20   This system, decoded by Austrian scientist Karl von Frisch in the
     1940s, earned him a Nobel Prize. What made his discovery so
     significant was not just the complexity of the communication but
     its abstract nature. The bees are not pointing toward the food
     or leading others there; they are using a symbolic language where
25   movements represent real-world information—direction and distance
     translated into angles and time.

     In this sense, the waggle dance represents one of the most
     sophisticated forms of non-human communication ever discovered,
     a tiny insect's solution to a problem that humans might solve
30   with GPS coordinates and text messages.
```

## Passage D: Poetry Selection

```
     My grandmother's hands tell stories
     her mouth never speaks—
     the calluses from factory years,
     the burn scar from a childhood stove,
5    the wedding ring grown thin
     as a thread of gold.

     When she kneads the bread dough,
     I watch those hands transform—
     rough and gentle all at once,
10   pressing, folding, knowing
     without thought how much is enough,
     when to wait, when to push.

     She never went to school past twelve,
     never read the books I read,
15   but her hands hold knowledge
     no classroom ever taught:
     how to calm a crying child,
     how to coax a stubborn seed,
     how to say goodbye
20   to everyone she's loved and lost.

     I am young and soft-palmed still,
     my stories not yet written.
     But sometimes when I bake,
     I feel her hands guiding mine,
25   teaching through touch
     what words can never hold.
