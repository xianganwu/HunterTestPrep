## Passage A: The Underground Library

```
     In 1970, a group of teenagers in New York City discovered something
     remarkable beneath the streets of the Lower East Side. While exploring
     an abandoned subway tunnel, they stumbled upon thousands of books
     stacked against damp walls, their pages yellowed but still readable.
5    The collection, they later learned, had been assembled over decades
     by a man named Theodore Crane, a former librarian who had lost his
     job during the Great Depression.

     Unable to bear the thought of books being destroyed, Crane had
     spent forty years rescuing volumes destined for incinerators and
10   garbage trucks. He transported them by wheelbarrow and shopping
     cart to his underground sanctuary, organizing them by subject with
     handwritten cards tucked into each spine. There were novels in
     twelve languages, scientific treatises from the 1800s, and first
     editions of poetry collections that scholars had believed were lost.

15   Crane had died in 1965, five years before the teenagers' discovery.
     His underground library, containing an estimated 40,000 books, had
     remained untouched, protected by the constant cool temperature of
     the tunnel. When news of the find spread, the city faced a dilemma:
     the books were too valuable to ignore but too numerous to easily
20   relocate. A preservation team spent three years cataloging and
     carefully moving the collection to the New York Public Library,
     where a special wing now bears Crane's name.

     Today, visitors can see a recreation of Crane's tunnel library,
     complete with the original shelving he built from discarded wooden
25   crates. The exhibit serves as a reminder that preservation often
     depends not on institutions with vast resources, but on individuals
     with stubborn devotion to what they love.

## Passage B: The Migrations

```
     Twice each year, the Arctic tern embarks on a journey that
     defies human imagination. This small seabird, weighing barely
     four ounces, travels from its Arctic breeding grounds to the
     Antarctic and back again—a round trip of approximately 44,000
5    miles. Over its lifetime of 30 years, a single tern may fly
     the equivalent distance of three trips to the moon and back.

     Scientists long wondered how these birds navigate such vast
     distances with such precision. Recent research has revealed
     that Arctic terns possess multiple navigation systems working
10   in concert. They can detect Earth's magnetic field, essentially
     carrying an internal compass. They also use the position of
     the sun and stars, the patterns of polarized light in the sky,
     and even their sense of smell to recognize familiar coastlines.

     Perhaps most remarkably, Arctic terns do not simply fly the
15   shortest route between poles. Instead, they follow a winding
     path that takes advantage of prevailing winds, effectively
     "surfing" air currents to conserve energy. A tern flying from
     Greenland to Antarctica might first head east toward Europe,
     then south along the African coast, before finally crossing
20   to South America and continuing to Antarctica.

     This indirect route, while longer in distance, actually requires
     less effort than fighting against headwinds on a direct path.
     The terns have evolved over millions of years to find the most
     efficient journey, not the shortest one—a distinction that human
25   travelers, with our obsession with straight lines and speed,
     often fail to appreciate.
```

### Question 7

The phrase "defies human imagination" in line 2 suggests that the tern's journey is

(A) impossible for scientists to study
(B) beyond what humans can easily comprehend
(C) guided by supernatural forces
(D) frequently exaggerated in reports

(A) Earth's magnetic field
(B) the position of celestial bodies
(C) patterns of light in the sky

(A) allows them to find more food along the way
(B) helps them avoid predators in certain regions
(C) enables them to use wind patterns to save energy
(D) gives younger birds time to build strength
(E) follows the paths established by their ancestors

### Question 10

In line 17, "surfing" is used to describe how terns

(A) dive into ocean waves to catch fish
(B) ride air currents to reduce effort
(C) compete with other birds for resources

(A) criticize modern transportation systems
(B) suggest humans should travel more like birds
(C) contrast human thinking with the terns' evolved wisdom

## Passage C: The Inventor's Notebook

```
     Eliza Chen had filled seventeen notebooks by the time she turned
     twelve. Each one contained sketches of machines that existed only
     in her imagination: a device for translating birdsong into human
     words, shoes that could walk on ceilings, a backpack that folded
5    into a working umbrella. Her teachers called her creative. Her
     classmates called her weird. Eliza preferred to think of herself
     as someone who saw possibilities instead of problems.

     "That's impossible," her brother Marcus would say, flipping through
     her pages with the skeptical eye of a fourteen-year-old who had
10   already decided what the world would and wouldn't allow. But Eliza
     had read about the Wright brothers, about Marie Curie, about all
     the people throughout history who had been told their ideas were
     impossible until they weren't.

     Her current project was her most ambitious yet: a system for
15   collecting rainwater from the air in dry climates, using principles
     she had read about in a library book on desert beetles. The beetles'
     shells had microscopic bumps that attracted water from fog, and
     Eliza was trying to design a fabric that could do the same thing.
     Her first prototype, made from a modified window screen and some
20   textured plastic, sat on her desk collecting dust instead of water.

     "Maybe Marcus is right," she thought one evening, staring at her
     failed experiment. But then she remembered something her grandmother
     had told her: "The difference between a failure and an inventor is
     that the inventor writes down what went wrong and tries again."
25   Eliza opened notebook number eighteen.
```

### Question 13

The phrase "saw possibilities instead of problems" (line 7) reveals that Eliza

(A) ignored obstacles that stood in her way
(B) focused on what could be created rather than limitations
(C) refused to listen to other people's opinions
(D) preferred fantasy over reality
(E) had difficulty understanding practical concerns

(B) show that Eliza has read many history books
(C) provide examples of people who overcame skepticism
(D) compare different types of inventions
(E) explain why Marcus should be more supportive

### Question 16

Based on the passage, Eliza's rainwater collection idea was inspired by

(A) a conversation with her grandmother
(B) a science experiment at school
(C) research about desert insects
(D) watching rain fall on her window
(E) one of Marcus's suggestions

### Question 17

The grandmother's words in lines 23-24 suggest that

(A) failure is always the result of poor planning
(B) inventors should never share their ideas with others
(C) learning from mistakes is essential to invention
(D) writing is more important than building prototypes
(E) some people are born to be inventors while others are not

(B) Eliza is ready to try again despite her failure
(C) Eliza needs more notebooks to hold all her ideas
(D) Eliza wants to draw something other than inventions
(E) Eliza is going to show her work to her grandmother

## Passage D: Poetry Selection

```
     The subway doors slide shut, and we begin
     our journey underground, a metal snake
5    that winds through tunnels carved by other hands
     in decades we will never know. The dark
     presses against the windows, broken only
     by the blur of stations flashing past,
     each one a bright island in the night.

10   I watch the faces of my fellow travelers—
     the woman with her sleeping child curled soft
     against her shoulder, the man who reads
     a battered paperback, its spine creased deep
     from countless journeys just like this. We share
15   this space, this moment hurtling through the dark,
     strangers bound by nothing but the route.

     And yet I wonder what we'd find if we
     could see inside each other's minds—what hopes,
     what fears, what ordinary miracles
20   are riding with us now? The train slows down,
     the doors slide open, and the woman leaves,
     her child still sleeping, dreaming who knows what.
     I watch them disappear into the crowd,
     two stories I will never finish reading.
