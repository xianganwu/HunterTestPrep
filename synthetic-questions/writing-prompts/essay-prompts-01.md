## Prompt 1: A Moment of Change

Life is full of small moments that change us—sometimes in ways we don't notice until much later. These might be a conversation with a stranger, a book we read, a mistake we made, or a success we didn't expect.

**Write about a moment that changed how you see yourself or the world around you.**

Your writing should:
- Describe the moment with specific, vivid details
- Explain what you thought or felt before and after
- Show how this moment continues to affect you

## Prompt 2: The Sound of Home

Every place has its own sounds—the rumble of the subway, the hum of the refrigerator, voices calling from down the hall. These sounds become so familiar that we often stop noticing them until they're gone.

**Write about the sounds of a place that feels like home to you.**

Your writing should:
- Use sensory details to bring the sounds to life
- Explain why these sounds matter to you
- Show what this place means in your life

## Prompt 3: Someone You Admire

We often admire people not just for what they accomplish, but for how they face challenges, treat others, or stay true to themselves. The person you admire might be famous, or they might be someone only you know.

**Write about a person you admire and what you have learned from them.**

Your writing should:
- Describe this person vividly so readers can picture them
- Give specific examples that show why you admire them
- Explain how knowing this person has influenced you

## Prompt 4: A New York Story

**Write a true or fictional story set in New York City.**

Your writing should:
- Include specific details that bring the city to life
- Create characters the reader can understand
- Build to a meaningful ending or realization

## Prompt 5: The Thing You Keep

Many of us hold onto objects that others might consider worthless—a worn stuffed animal, a crumpled letter, a rock from a beach. These items become important not for what they're worth, but for what they represent.

**Write about an object you've kept and why it matters to you.**

Your writing should:
- Describe the object so readers can picture it clearly
- Tell the story of how you came to have it
- Explain what this object represents in your life

## Prompt 6: A Difficult Decision

Life presents us with choices, and sometimes the right path isn't clear. Making difficult decisions can teach us about our values and who we want to become.

**Write about a time you had to make a difficult decision.**

Your writing should:
- Describe the situation and the options you faced
- Explain your thought process and what you considered
- Share what you learned from making this choice

## Prompt 7: Creative Continuation

Read the beginning of this story, then continue it in your own words:

*The elevator doors opened on the 42nd floor, but instead of the familiar hallway leading to my aunt's apartment, I found myself looking at a forest. Tall trees stretched toward a sky that shouldn't have been visible from inside a building, and somewhere in the distance, I heard running water...*

**Continue this story. What happens next?**

Your writing should:
- Continue naturally from the opening
- Develop the setting and any characters
- Create tension, mystery, or discovery
- Build toward a meaningful ending or cliffhanger

---

## Prompt 8: An Unexpected Teacher

Sometimes our best teachers aren't in classrooms. They might be siblings, neighbors, coaches, or even people we only met once. Learning can happen anywhere, often when we least expect it.

**Write about something important you learned outside of school and who taught you.**

Your writing should:
- Describe the person and situation clearly
- Explain what you learned and how you learned it
- Show why this lesson has stayed with you

---

## Prompt 9: If Walls Could Talk

Buildings, rooms, and spaces hold memories. If the walls of a place you know well could speak, what stories would they tell? What have they witnessed?

**Choose a place you know well and write from the perspective of that place, describing what it has seen and experienced.**

Your writing should:
- Choose an interesting and specific place
- Use creative description from the place's "point of view"
- Include meaningful events or moments the place has witnessed
- Show why this place matters to the people who use it

---

## Prompt 10: A Letter to Your Future Self

Imagine you are writing a letter that you will read in ten years, when you are 21 or 22 years old.

**Write a letter to your future self about who you are now and who you hope to become.**

Your writing should:
- Describe your current life, hopes, and concerns
- Ask questions you hope your future self can answer
- Share advice or reminders for your future self
- Be honest and genuine in your writing

---

## Prompt 11: The Bridge Between

Bridges connect two places, but they can also represent connections between people, ideas, or times in our lives. Think about bridges—both literal and symbolic—in your own experience.

**Write about a "bridge" in your life—something or someone that connected two parts of your experience.**

Your writing should:
- Clearly explain what the "bridge" is (person, place, experience, etc.)
- Describe what it connects
- Show why this connection matters

---

## Prompt 12: An Ordinary Day

Writers often say that the most interesting stories come from ordinary moments, looked at carefully. A regular Tuesday can reveal as much about life as any adventure.

**Describe an ordinary day in your life as if it were extraordinary.**

Your writing should:
- Focus on specific, small details
- Find meaning or beauty in everyday moments
- Help readers see the familiar in a new way
